Checks for reference counting implementation.


- get swapList and mapList working.

Steals code from: https://github.com/bollu/lambdapure/tree/master/tests/bench 

- bst: insert into a BST. [NOT IMPLEMENTED YET]
- filter: filter elements from a list
- listSum: sum elements in a list.
- mapTee: map a function over a tree. 
- mapList: map a function over a list. 
- pair: convert nodes  of a linked list
       that hold two numbers to nodes that hold a single number
       (the sum of two numbers)
- sort: bubble sort a linked list [STUB; DOES NOT WORK]
- swapTree: swap left and right children recursively of a binary tree
